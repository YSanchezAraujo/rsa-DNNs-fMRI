# RSA between deepnets and fMRI data from the sherlock dataset

502b project of Yoel Sanchez Araujo and Jorge Yanar

## TODO

- [x] Download data, and stim
- [x] Get AlexNet activations to the movies
- [x] Run searchlight on the fmri files to get the fmri matrices for RSA
- [x] Perform searchlight RSA between fMRI and each deepnet layer's activations
- [ ] Run "second level" group stats on the results
